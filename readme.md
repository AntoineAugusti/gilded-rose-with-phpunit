# The Gilded Rose Kata

Begin by cloning this repository. 

```
git clone https://github.com/laracasts/gilded-rose-with-phpunit.git
```

You'll find two Git branches. If you'd like to skip ahead, the `completed` branch contains the finished source code. Otherwise, the master branch should be your starting position for the refactor.

## Your Job

1. Refactor the `GildedRose` class
2. Add the new "Conjured" item type.
